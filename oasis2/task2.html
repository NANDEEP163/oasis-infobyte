        Albert Einstein was a German theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity,
        one of the two pillars of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics).
        His famous equation E=mc² shows the relationship between mass and energy.
        He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.

        Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire.
        He passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, USA, but his contributions to science
        continue to inspire and shape our understanding of the universe.
